# Monk's Common Display
Add-On Module for Foundry VTT
Set up a display without all the ui so that it can be displayed on an alternate screen.

## Installation
Simply use the install module screen within the FoundryVTT setup

## Usage & Current Features
Using the common display toolbar, you can change settings, clear any open images on the display screen, or toggle the display screen mirroring your actions.

Changing the settings will let you select which player is to be used as your display player.  You can also set if the player is capable of mirroring the GM's screen.  So when screen mirroring is turned on, it will only affect displays that allow it.  You can also clear images for individuals using this window.

Pressing the clear images tool bar button will clear any open images for display players.

Toggling the Mirror Screen button will allow your position and scale to be mirrored on the common display.  This can be toggled off so that you can move the screen somewhere else.

You can also configure if you want the side menu to show with the chat log.  Or if you want the combat to be displayed.  If combat is displayed, it will be automatically closed when the combat has ended.

## Bug Reporting
