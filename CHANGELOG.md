Adding support for Image Hover module

Changed the design so instead of adding a comma separated list of player names in the config settings, I added a window to be able to change all the settings on the fly.  So you can turn the display settings on and off while running the game.  You can also turn off screen mirroring for specific displays, and clear images for specific displays.  This update will also remember if the player was set as a display last session and disable the UI immediately when loading.  It should provide a cleaner experience.
