# Version 10.1

Totally updated the interface.  
You can now show a control bar that lets you select if you want the display screen to mirror, the GM, mirror the current combatant, or mirror a specific token.
You can also set which token has control focus on it.  The one the current GM has selected, the current combatant, or a specific token.

You can toggle if you want either the screen or focus to be active by clicking on the image, and you can change the type of each by right clicking.

The settings to turn a player into the common display is now in the settings.  And the toggle on the toolbar opens up the window with all the controls.

You can also toggle a player being the Common Display by right clicking on the player name in the player list and selecting "Show As Common Display"

You can also clear all images and all journals from buttons on the control window, and you can set shared images to clear after a certain number of seconds.

Changed the design so instead of adding a comma separated list of player names in the config settings, I added a window to be able to change all the settings on the fly.  So you can turn the display settings on and off while running the game.  You can also turn off screen mirroring for specific displays, and clear images for specific displays.  This update will also remember if the player was set as a display last session and disable the UI immediately when loading.  It should provide a cleaner experience.
